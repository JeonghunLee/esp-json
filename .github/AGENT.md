- Avoid generating boilerplate code unless explicitly requested.

## Scope of Assistance
- Provide context-aware code completions (Copilot).
- Answer questions about the current file or folder (Copilot Chat).
- Suggest tests and documentation when asked.
- Do **not** modify build, dependency, or CI settings unless asked directly.
